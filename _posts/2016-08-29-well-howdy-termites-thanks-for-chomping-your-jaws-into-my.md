Well howdy, termites! Thanks for chomping your jaws into my wood!

My name is Geoff and I'm a beginner woodworker. Which means I make wood shit, but I don't do it nearly as well as a ton of other people. The good news is I learn quickly, especially when it's a subject I love, and I loves me some wood!

So thanks for tuning in and following me on my journey.
