![Did I ever tell you I published a book of horror stories? I did, two of them. I don't do that anymore, I've pretty much sworn off it forever, but this is a pretty cool wood burning I did of the logo I made up for the anthologies. So at least there's that.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1ae07197-6039-4f3b-a756-f1b16bf3a91b.jpg)
