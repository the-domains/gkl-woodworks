  This was a project from my first woodworking class. To be clear, not only did

![Did I ever tell you I published a book of horror stories? I did, two of them. I don't do that anymore, I've pretty much sworn off it forever, but this is a pretty cool wood burning I did of the logo I made up for the anthologies. So at least there's that.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2cc3d4ddbd4243e6898a35deef820d758dfbfb0c.jpg)
![Pennywise woodburning. And indeed that is cat vomit in the corner of the picture. My cats believe there is nothing like vomiting on fresh MDF, especially right before I take a picture.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/37afaa7f95ce4e38a6f27693ac1c0e6e7e547d2e.jpg)

Stupid me thought maybe I could fix it if I sealed over it, like the seal would re-darken those spots. I was mistaken.
